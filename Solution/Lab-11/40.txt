40. Write algorithms to perform following operations on a simple queue:
i. Insert
ii. Delete

1. check if queue is full
  if rare == size - 1
    return overflow
  else if front == -1
    front = 0
  rare = rare + 1
  queue[rare] = item

2. check if queue is empty
  if front == -1 || front > rare
    return underflow
  else
    item = queue[front]
    front = front + 1
    return item
