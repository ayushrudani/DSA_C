43. Write algorithms to perform following operations on a circular queue:
i. Insert
ii. Delete

1. Insert
    -reset rare 
    if rare = size
    rare = 1
    else
    rare = rare + 1
    -overflow
    if front = rare
    print overflow
    -insert
    queue[rare] = item
    -if front set proper
    if front = 0
    front = 1
2. Delete   
    -underflow
    if front = 0
    print underflow
    -delete
    item = queue[front]
    -reset front
    if front = rare
    front = 0
    else
    front = front + 1
    -return item
